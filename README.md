# Data-Visualization-Works

Some data visualization work made with Python using plotly, requests.

The first folder is a simple API call program using data from Github. It will create a simple bar graph with the most starred Python projects on Github. You can also click the name of the project to go to the corresponding repository.

The second folder is a world map with 30 days of earthquakes' magnitude data with different colorizations. When hover over individual earthquake point you can see the exact location and the level of earthquake.

The third folder is a scatter plot of 5000 random walks. Each step has a random coordination, and after all 5000 steps have been determined there will be a graph showing the starting point and end point. There is also color customization for each step, going from ligher color to deeper color.
